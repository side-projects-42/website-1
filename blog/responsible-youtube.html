    This is part one in a series describing the tools and devices I use to mitigate distractions like suggested content and ads on the web. I enjoy listening to youtube videos to learn about science, computers, politics, and culture. Youtube is a great platform for this, but not without its flaws. My biggest complaints with Youtube are the following: video suggestions are not solely based on the video currently being watched, endless suggestions/content, listening to youtube videos requires the youtube app be open. This post will describe a solution to the last point.

<br>
Navigate to the <a href="https://github.com/zricethezav/zachstalks/">zachstalks github page</a>. This is a project I created that downloads the audio of a youtube video using youtube-dl then uploads the audio to the internet archive. This allows you to listen to youtube audio in a browser. This is my preferred method of listening to youtube talks as I can go to the gym or play basketball while listening to the talks on my phone without draining my phone's battery with the youtube app.

<br>
If you want to get started on using this project I recommend forking the repo and removing the "talks" section in <a href="https://github.com/zricethezav/zachstalks/blob/master/README.md">README.md</a> unless you want to include the talks I already have uploaded.
