    His iPhone 6s jingled and vibrated three time at 7:00am. He thought the vibration did a better job at snapping him out of his dreams and into the waking world than the alarm jingle. The phone's vibration was violent compared to the soft sound of the "Ripples" soundbite being repeated. He would change the alarm jingle approximately every four months. He went from "Radiate" to "Sencha" to "Signal" to the obnoxious "Summit" to "Slow Rise" and finally to "Ripples". He found that changing the jingle gave him a something to monitor as it relates to his morning routine and mood -- will he hit snooze no times, 1 time, or n times? He had a bad habit of hitting the snooze button at least 6 times, delaying his morning by an hour. "Ripples" and "Slow Rise" were was his favorite. "Slow Rise" reminded him of a sunrise across the frozen fields of the Midwest in December. He imagined this is what the designers of "Slow Rise" intended. He wasn't sure what "Ripples" reminded him of.

The phone vibrated and chimed on his nightstand which held held his keys, Kleenex box, lamp, phone, nasal spray, and wallet. Inside the only drawer of his nightstand concealed 500gb seagate external hard drive from 2013, a pack of marlboros his friend left at his apartment but forgot to pick up (his girlfriend tried to get him to throw the pack of smokes out but he insisted that in the face of a cataclysm it's good to have a pack of smokes around), an extra pair of glasses, some change, a plastic bag full of thumb drives, and loose nyquil/dayquil (combo pack) pills he never took. He interacted with the items on the top of his night stand daily. The items in the drawer were mostly left in the dark besides for maybe once a month when he needed to transfer files from one machine to an other.

The vibration of his phone transferred energy from the nightstand, to the hardwood floor that was poorly maintained, up to the amazon dot com bought bed frame, to the memory foam mattress which absorbed most of the vibration, and finally into his skull. His skull housed a brain and the brain reacted to the vibration by telling the body that brain controlled to get up. But the body was slow and massive and rejected the brains request. The brain attempted a compromise with the body thinking "I won't make you get up, but the least you could do is turn off the alarm so that we both can forget about this whole morning thing and snooze a bit more". The body agreed and the arm on that body attempted to grab the phone and his "snooze". The arm clumsily knocked the phone off the night stand causing an emergency situation to both the body and the brain. "Shit" the brain thought and the body felt. He woke up.
