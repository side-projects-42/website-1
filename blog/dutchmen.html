The Dutchmen walked into the cafe and breakfast joint to play slot machines. They walked past me. No reaction. No recognition of my presence. Two of the three Dutchmen hunched over one of the two slot machines machines. They asked asked the third Dutchman for some money. The third dipped into the register and handed them some money. They began to lose.
<br>
<br>
"Can I do something for you?" asked the third Dutchman. "Yes, I would like a coffee and some eggs on toast with cheese", I replied. He scribbled something down and walked outside to smoke a cigarette. The two Dutchmen were still playing video poker. Staring at the 7s, cherries, grapes, diamonds, and other slot machine symbols they said nothing and remained in the same position. The third Dutchman walked backed into the cafe and at full volume sang "How many roads must a man walk down...". before trailing off because he didn't remember the words. He would hum the melody to fill in the words he did not know. Again, "How many roads must a man walk down...". The third Dutchman was younger and tanner than the other two. He made the coffee. It was good coffee. He walked backed to the kitchen and began to make the eggs with cheese. 
<br>
<br>
Outside the cafe was the Albert Cuypmarkt. Every day besides Sunday there would be vendors setting up shop outside for the market. Albert Cuypmarkt stretched along a mid-to-outter ring of Amsterdam in De Pijp. Vendors from this market would enter the cafe and walk back to the kitchen, walk down a step, open a small door, and come back with a register or some other equipment that was needed for their shops. No words were spoken between the vendors and the Dutchmen.
<br>
<br>
The third Dutchman came back humming, and dropped the food in front of me. I ate the eggs with cheese and ignored the toast. The cheese was Gouda. There was a lot of cheese. 3 eggs and 2 thick slices of cheese melted on top of the eggs.
<br>
<br>
The two Dutchmen in front of the slot machines asked for some more money. "This place has to be a front or some shit" I thought to myself. Do the Dutch have a mob? 
<br>
<br>
I wanted to ask the two Dutchmen why they played these slot machines if they weren't betting their own money. What's the point? You have no stake in these games if you are betting with the cafe's money.
<br>
<br>
I got the third Dutchman's attention and asked for the check. "9.50" he said. I gave him the money and said "thank you". I walked out of the cafe with an earworm and a question. How many roads must a man walk down? A lot. Walking is good. Everyone knows this.
