    Mallory 2024 -- The Future of Content
<br>
<br>
Mallory sat at her computer. She stared at her screen for a minute before entering her password. During that minute she didn't think and wasn't sure if time was passing her by. Her login name was "mal‚Äù and password was "words_are_safe_111;". Her computer was running Windows 21, the successor to Windows 11. Microsoft thought they would welcome the Windows operating system into the 2020's by dropping the '1' in Windows 11 and replacing it with a '2'. Windows 21 was released December 15th 2021 after some delays. She typed in her password and pressed enter.

Mallory was a streamer on all major streaming platforms; Youtube, Twitch, and PremiumStream. Youtube had been around since 2006 and Twitch had been around since 2011 (2007 if you count justin.tv), but PremiumStream was a relatively new streaming service that was created in 2022 which exploded in popularity. PremiumStream was a luxury streaming service that offered some unique features that Youtube and Twitch did not. The streamer on PremiumStream would set a number of available slots where users who could afford the slots would gain access to exclusive content. Most of the time, PremiumStream streamers would set up a separate camera to broadcast their content to the lucky few who could afford the exclusive stream. Mallory usually set the number of available PremiumStream slots to 100 on weekdays and 1000 on weekends. She wasn't sure how much money she had or made but knew it wasn't a problem. She charged $50/hour for her premium stream and made money from advertisements and donations on Youtube and Twitch.

Mallory was 22 years old and had been streaming for four years. She had the most subscribers in the IRL category on all three platforms.

...I'm actually going to stop writing because the reality of streaming culture is absurd and way meta.
